Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create _websites_,_ebooks_,_email_,_chats in discussions forums_.

## Topics

1. Paragraphs

   MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.

2. Text decorations

   MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italiic~~ _italic_ texts

3. Headings
   No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked.
   ## This is h2
   ### This is h3
4. Links

   [My Github](https://github.com/bhupendra1011 'all repos') account.[Bhupendra][1] github repo.

5. Images
   Images can be used just like links. ![Alt txt](img url)

   ![cat Img](http://placekitten.com/200/200)

   Thumbnails images can also be used which links to larger image
   [<img src="http://placekitten.com/20/20" />](http://placekitten.com/200/200)

6. Ordered and Unordered Lists

   Coding Best Practices:

   - Keep code DRY
   - Writing Unit Test cases
   - Checking cross-browser support

   Steps to merge branch:

   1. Create a branch from feature
   1. commit your changes
   1. push your changes
   1. raise a pull request

7. Code Blocks

   This is super helpful when posting any code snippet


    ```
      const fn = () => alert("some fn");
    ```

8. Tables

   Tables can be generated with headings and text alignment option

   |  Stocks  | Price |

   | YES Bank |   500 |
